## About Me:
<b>I'm Diogo Silva, and I bring four years of experience as a graphic designer. However, my passion for programming and technology has been a constant driving force in my journey. Currently, I'm pursuing Full Stack Development at 42 Porto.
My programming journey started with Python and C, and I'm now expanding my skills into C++. With a strong desire to tackle challenges head-on, I'm always eager to learn and grow.
