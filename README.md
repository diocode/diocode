## About Me:
Hi, I’m **Diogo Silva** — a software developer with a background in design, now focused on **back-end development** at 42 Porto. I started with **C** and **C++**, and have since added **Python**, **MySQL**, and **API** work to my toolkit.

I enjoy writing clean code, solving problems, and learning new technologies.
Check out my projects to see what I’ve been working on!
